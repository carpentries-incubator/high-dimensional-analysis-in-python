# Introduction - what is high dimensional data?

### What is data?

#### da·ta
/ˈdadə, ˈdādə/
_noun_
"the quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer"

—Oxford Languages


(how is data formatted? structured, semi-structured, unstructured: flat file, json, raw text)

There is a conversion to numerical representation happening here

A rectangular dataset:
Original data set not rectangular, might require conversion that produces high dimensional rectangular data set.

We’re discussing structured, rectangular data only today.

## What is a dimension?

### di·men·sion
/dəˈmen(t)SH(ə)n, dīˈmen(t)SH(ə)n/

_noun_
noun: __dimension__; plural noun: __dimensions__
1. a measurable extent of some kind, such as length, breadth, depth, or height.
2. an aspect or feature of a situation, problem, or thing.

## A Dataset
1. Some number of observations > 1
2. every feature of an observation is a dimension
3. the number of observations i.e. the index, is not a dimension


# Examples of datasets with increasing dimensionality

### 1 D

1. likert scale question (index: respondent_id, question value (-3 to 3)

### 2 D

1. scatter plot (x, y)
2. two question survey (index: respondent_id, q1 answer, q2 answer)
3. data from temperature logger: (index: logged_value_id, time, value)


### 3 D

1. surface (x, y, z)
2. scatter plot with variable as size per point (x, y, size)
3. 2d black and white image (x, y, pixel_value)
4. moves log from a game of 'battleship' (index: move number, x-coord, y-coord, hit/miss)
5. [consecutive pulses of CP 1919](https://www.wemadethis.co.uk/blog/2015/03/unknown-pleasures-and-cp-1919/) (time, x, y)

> > ## Solution
> > ### 3d: move_id is an index!

## High-Dimensional Data

What is high-dimensional data? Unfortunately, there isn’t a precise definition. Often, when people use the term, they are referring to specific problems and headaches that arise when working with data that has many (typically dozens or more) features (a.k.a. dimensions). These problems are generally referred to as the "curse of dimensionality".

### Curse of Dimensionality

The “curse of dimensionality” refers to the challenges that arise when dealing with data in high-dimensional spaces. These challenges include:

- **Overfitting in Models:** Machine learning models are prone to overfitting when the number of features approaches or exceeds the number of observations in the data. In this context, what is considered "high-dimensional is relative to the number of observations in your data.
- **Increased Computational Complexity:** As dimensions increase, so do compute needs both in terms of memory and processing power. This can make the analysis more difficult.
- **Visualization Challenges:** Visualizing data with many features becomes challenging, as humans can easily comprehend only up to three dimensions.
- **Increased Sparsity:** As dimensions increase, the volume of the space grows exponentially, making data points more spread out and less dense.
- **Reduced Meaningfulness of Distance:** As dimensions increase, the concept of distance between data points becomes less intuitive and less useful for distinguishing between different points.
  
Throughout this workshop, we'll see how these challenges, or "curses," apply to our research goals and explore strategies to address them.
